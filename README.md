## 💭 Motivation

This micro plugin is a small coffee break project to take a peek into Figma plugin development. In our team we were sometimes missing sticky notes to annotate things when presenting a canvas. Since the commenting feature wasn't visual enough and duplicating the same sticky note template across projects was annoying -- I've created this small plugin.
